		<h3>The PHD Party thanks you for you support. A Message from David:</h3>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">
			From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank all of you who made this possible. For the last eight months, it has been an honor and a privilege to serve you as the Assembly Speaker, and I promise you that I will bring the same passion, energy, and devotion to the presidency from this moment on, until the day I graduate from Brooklyn College.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">
			I want to congratulate all the newly-elected members of our government for their achievements, and thank them for their work these last few days. I look forward to working closely with each of you, and plan to assist in the transition in every way I can.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">	
			I cannot fully express my appreciation for the people who made all this possible-especially those who did not have a position to run for. The names of all these people would be too much to write out, but I would like to give a shout-out to Joshua Hoffman, Charlie Kerr, Tim Andrew Donnelly, and Abraham Haimed. I would be writing a very different statement without you guys.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">
			This list would be incomplete without mentioning the USL Floor Leader Kenji Logie. Over the last eight months, the partnership between two formerly bitter rivals has ushered in a new era of achievement and progress. And our success these last few months would've been impossible without Kenji's hard work.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">
			I am not sure how I would've been able to do any of this without my trusted deputy and dear friend, Vice President-elect Ayala Lieberman. Ayala, you have no idea how much you have done for me, and how much our friendship means to me. I cannot imagine having done this with anyone else, and for that I can only say thank you.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 1.2em">
			But more important than anyone else, I want to thank Jamell Henderson for running a clean campaign, putting a noble fight, and making sure that I stayed on the issues, and making sure that I was doing everything I had to for the students of Brooklyn College. Jamell, though the last few days have been intense, I really do consider you a friend and a partner, and I look forward to working with you over the next year.
